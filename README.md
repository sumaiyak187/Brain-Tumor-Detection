# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using MATLAB

This project detects and segments brain tumors from MRI images using rule-based image processing techniques in MATLAB.

## 🧩 Techniques Used
- Median Filtering
- Sobel Edge Detection
- Morphological Operations
- Thresholding and Region Extraction
- Area-based Tumor Identification

## 📊 Results
- Successfully detected tumor regions in 80% of test MRI scans
- Includes one failed case for analysis

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `src/` — MATLAB scripts
- `data/` — MRI input images
- `results/` — Segmented outputs
- `report/` — Final project report (PDF)
